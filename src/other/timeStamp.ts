// 1. Using the Built-in Date Object:

// The native Date object in JavaScript provides methods for obtaining timestamps

// This approach uses the toISOString() method of Date to get a timestamp in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-04-15T13:52:22.123Z").

const timestamp = new Date().toISOString(); // Gets current timestamp in ISO 8601 format







// 1. Obtaining Month and Day from Date Object:

// date: This represents a JavaScript Date object. You might create a new Date object using new Date() or obtain it from another source like user input.
// date.getMonth(): This method retrieves the numeric month value (0-indexed) from the Date object. January is 0, February is 1, and so on.
// 2. Adding 1 to Month:

// date.getMonth() + 1: Here, 1 is added to the result of date.getMonth(). This is because in JavaScript's Date object, months are zero-indexed (starting from 0 for January). By adding 1, we convert the value to a more human-readable format, where January becomes 1, February becomes 2, and so on.
// 3. Converting to String:

// String(date.getMonth() + 1): This part explicitly converts the result of the previous expression (which might be a number) to a JavaScript string data type. This ensures compatibility with the padStart method, which expects a string argument.
// 4. Zero-Padding with padStart:

// .padStart(2, '0'): This method is called on the string representation of the month. It takes two arguments:
// 2: This specifies the target length of the resulting string. In this case, it ensures the month value will always have two characters.
// '0': This is the padding character. If the month value (as a string) has less than two characters, leading zeros will be added to the left to reach the target length of two.

const MyComponent = () => {
  const date = new Date();
  const year = date.getFullYear();
  const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); // Zero-pad month
  const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
  const hours = String(date.getHours()).padStart(2, '0');
  const minutes = String(date.getMinutes()).padStart(2, '0');
  const seconds = String(date.getSeconds()).padStart(2, '0');

  const timestamp = `${year}-${month}-${day} ${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`;

}




// 3. Updating Timestamp (Optional):

// To update the timestamp dynamically, consider using the setInterval function from the react library:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';


const MyComponent1 = () => {
  const [timestamp, setTimestamp] = useState(new Date().toISOString());

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTimestamp(new Date().toISOString());
    }, 1000); // Update every second

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

 
};

// This approach uses useState to manage the state of the timestamp and useEffect with setInterval to refresh the timestamp in the component's state every second.
